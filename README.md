# DetermineDivisibility
Program with a function that receives four integers and determines whether it is divisible by the integer and returns the result as a list of strings

This program:

Receives 4 integers ( m, n, a, b ) and for each number in the range [ m, n ] (inclusive) determines whether it is divisible by a , or it is divisible by b , or both a and b or by neither a nor b and returns the result as a list of strings, each string as separate list element.


Challenge: Without using the built-in Python len() method. Wrote own length() function that returns the length of the string passed as argument to the function.
